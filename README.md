# java-capstone-final-project
Final Project for Java Capstone taken 2013-2014 at Suncoast High School
This was a class assignment meant to demonstrate the extent of our Computer Science education at Suncoast High School.
I created a program in Java that allows a user to create outfits, save them, and mark them as worn.
The idea behind this was that a user could "try" outfits on virtually and not have to waste time trying them on in real life.
Users could then mark outfits as worn so that they weren't worn too frequently.
